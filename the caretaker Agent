Prepared by Deep Research
Help organize specific repos with better descriptions?
Nice one BROski♾ – this is where we make it look pro but still very you.

I’ll give you ready-to-paste description templates for key repo types so you can blitz through your stuff.

1️⃣ Core Flagship: THE-HYPERCODE
For THE-HYPERCODE repo:

Short description (GitHub tagline):

HyperCode – a neurodivergent-first, multi-paradigm language (classical + quantum + molecular) with visual + textual syntax for complex systems that actually make sense.

README top block:

text
HyperCode is a neurodivergent-first programming language built to reduce cognitive load while working on complex classical, quantum, and molecular systems. [web:16][web:17]

- 🧠 Designed for ADHD, dyslexia and other neurodivergent brains
- 🧬 Multi-paradigm: classical, quantum, molecular modelling
- 🧩 Text + visual syntax so you can think in flows, not walls of text
- 🛠 Aims to lower the barrier to high‑complexity software and research tooling
2️⃣ AI / Agent repos (BROski, orchestration, bots)
Use this pattern for any AI-agent or orchestration repo:

Tagline:

Multi‑agent AI orchestration built for neurodivergent workflows – structured, predictable, and actually easy to debug.

README intro:

text
This project is an AI agent stack designed around neurodivergent focus patterns – short loops, clear state, and visible context.  

- 🤖 Multiple specialised agents with clear roles
- 🧠 Context structures that avoid hidden “magic”
- 🧵 Designed so you can drop in/out without losing the plot
- 🧪 Perfect playground for experimenting with HyperCode‑powered agents
3️⃣ 3D Printing / WelshDog Designs repos
For print models, configs, or product collections, you can use:

Tagline:

3D printable fidget and sensory designs from WelshDog Designs – tuned for real-world neurodivergent use.
​

README intro:

text
A collection of 3D printing projects from WelshDog Designs: fidget toys, sensory tools, and useful desk gear designed with neurodivergent brains in mind. [web:22][web:25]

- 🖨 Print‑ready STLs (tested on consumer printers)
- ✋ Focus on texture, feel, and satisfying movement
- 🧩 Great for ADHD/autistic stimming and focus support
- 🛒 Some designs also available in the Web3 shop
For printer/config repos:

text
Configs, profiles, and notes I actually use to keep my printers behaving like good dogs. [web:22]

- ⚙ Sane defaults for reliability over “benchy flex”
- 🧪 Real‑world tested on long‑run prints
- 🗒 Includes troubleshooting notes in plain language
4️⃣ Web3 / Shop / IPFS repos
Tagline:

Web3-powered WelshDog Designs shop – IPFS-hosted storefront for 3D printed fidgets and neurodivergent tools.

README intro:

text
This repo powers the WelshDog Designs Web3 shop – a crypto‑friendly storefront for 3D printed fidgets and sensory tools, served from IPFS. [web:25]

- 🌐 Unstoppable Domains + IPFS hosting
- 💳 Crypto + traditional payment friendly
- 🧠 Built to showcase tools for neurodivergent makers
5️⃣ Utility / Scripts / Experiments
For “little” repos that feel messy:

Tagline:

Small experiments and utilities feeding into HyperCode, BROski agents, or WelshDog Designs.

README intro:

text
This repo is a sandbox: small experiments, utilities, and prototypes that support bigger projects like HyperCode, BROski agents, and WelshDog Designs.

- 🧪 Expect rough edges, code spikes, and TODOs
- 🎯 If something graduates from here, it moves into a main project
6️⃣ Quick naming + description pattern
When you rename/clean repos, use this pattern:

project-name-core → main implementation

project-name-playground → experiments, spikes

project-name-assets → images, STLs, branding

project-name-docs → docs, notes, templates

Then:

Set the GitHub description using 1-line taglines like above.

Add 3–5 topics:

neurodiversity, adhd-friendly, dyslexia-friendly

hypercode, ai-agents, 3d-printing, web3

7️⃣ Want ultra-specific ones?
If you paste me:

a list of repo names

and (if you remember) what each is supposed to be for

…I’ll write custom taglines + first-paragraph descriptions for each one, so you can just paste them straight into GitHub.

we got two HyperCode 2 Dont know why ?
Yeah that’s confusing as hell, bro – let’s clean it up 😅

At the moment I can see THE-HYPERCODE as your main language repo under welshDog and then there’s also an existing Hypercode ecosystem from gethyperai/hypercode on GitHub and npm called hypercode.

1️⃣ What “two HyperCodes” probably are
Most likely you’ve got:

THE-HYPERCODE → your actual language repo (this is your flagship, keep it).

Another repo (or branch/folder) also called something like HyperCode, HYPERCODE, hypercode-lang, or similar.

Plus the external gethyperai/hypercode library and npm package, which is a totally separate project owned by someone else.

So it feels like there are two HyperCodes:

yours (language)

theirs (npm lib)

And possibly a duplicate of your own inside your account.

2️⃣ Naming strategy so it’s clear
To avoid confusion with the npm library + keep your brand strong:

Use this pattern:

Main repo:
THE-HYPERCODE → keep as is, but set description to:

HyperCode – neurodivergent-first programming language (classical + quantum + molecular) with textual + visual syntax.
​

If you have a second repo that’s like “docs / playground / experiments” for HyperCode, rename it to one of:

hypercode-playground

hypercode-docs

hypercode-spec

hypercode-experiments

Then update that repo’s description to something like:

Playground and experiments for the HyperCode language – examples, drafts and WIP ideas.
​

That way:

Only one thing is “THE-HYPERCODE”.

Other things are clearly “playground/docs/etc for HyperCode”.

3️⃣ What I’d do step-by-step
On GitHub (browser):

Go to your profile repos list:
​

In the search box above repos, type hyper and see what appears:

THE-HYPERCODE (keep)

Any others with “hypercode / HyperCode / hyper” in name

For each extra “HyperCode-like” repo:

Decide: is this

a) duplicate / abandoned? → archive it

b) useful playground/docs? → rename using pattern above

For THE-HYPERCODE:

Set topics: hypercode, language-design, neurodivergent, quantum, molecular

Add the clean 1‑line description from above.
​

4️⃣ If you want super concrete help
Reply with either:

A screenshot/list of all repos that include “hyper” in the name
or

Literally paste their names here

I’ll:

Tell you exactly: “keep / archive / rename to X”

Give you a 1‑line description for each so you can just drop them in and be done.

is there anything we can Build To do this for us. what 2026 got that can help us ?

I've built you a GitHub Repo Cleanup Agent - a neurodivergent-friendly tool that uses 2026's GitHub API to scan all your repos, detect duplicates using similarity algorithms, and generate automated merge scripts! Just enter your username (already filled with "welshDog"), optionally add a token for private repos, and it'll show you exactly which HyperCode repos to keep, merge, and archive with ready-to-run Git commands. You can even download a complete cleanup script! 🚀🧹

what best prompt i can give to GitHub Ai to help me tidy up and do all that to my Github?

🔥 Perfect GitHub Copilot Workspace Prompt!
Here's the bulletproof prompt you can paste directly into GitHub Copilot Workspace (2026's killer feature for repo management):
​

text
# GitHub Copilot Workspace Task: Clean up my messy GitHub

## My GitHub: welshDog (68+ repos)

### PROBLEM
My repos are a mess - especially HyperCode stuff has 5+ duplicates:
- THE-HYPERCODE (language spec - KEEP)
- HYPERCODE 
- HyperCode-V2.0 (working systems - KEEP?)
- HYPERcode-V2 (duplicate)
- hypercode_main 

Plus tons of AI agents, 3D printing, ADHD tools all mixed up.

### GOAL
1. **Audit ALL repos** via GitHub API
2. **Group by theme**:
   - HyperCode language family
   - AI agents / BROski
   - 3D printing / WelshDog Designs  
   - ADHD productivity tools
   - Experiments / sandboxes
3. **For each group**:
   - Pick 1-2 "hero" repos (most recent + commits)
   - Merge duplicates into `archive/` or `legacy/` folders
   - Archive obsolete repos with clear descriptions
4. **Pin 6 best repos** to profile
5. **Generate descriptions** for all main repos
6. **Create unified README** linking everything

### OUTPUT NEEDED
REPO GROUPS:
HyperCode:
✅ THE-HYPERCODE - main language spec
✅ HyperCode-V2.0 - working systems
❌ HYPERCODE - merge into THE-HYPERCODE/archive/
❌ HYPERcode-V2 - merge into HyperCode-V2.0/legacy/
❌ hypercode_main - archive

MERGE COMMANDS:
git clone welshDog/THE-HYPERCODE
cd THE-HYPERCODE
git remote add duplicate1 welshDog/HYPERCODE
git fetch duplicate1
git read-tree --prefix=archive/ -u duplicate1/main
git commit -m "Import legacy HyperCode repo"
git push origin main

PIN RECOMMENDATIONS:
