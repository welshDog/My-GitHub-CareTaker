## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.**
2.  Email `security@welshdog.io` (or your preferred contact).
3.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours.
4.  We will send a timeline for the fix.

## HyperCode Security

Our agents are designed to run with limited permissions. Please ensure your GitHub tokens have the **minimum required scopes** (usually `repo` and `user:read`).
