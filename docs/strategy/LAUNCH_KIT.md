## 📢 Platform 1: Reddit (r/Python, r/github, r/programming)

**Title:** I built a Python script that auto-optimizes your GitHub profile for SEO and discoverability 🚀

**Body:**
```markdown
Hey everyone,

I realized my GitHub profile was basically invisible to search engines and recruiters. Instead of manually updating it constantly, I wrote a Python script to do it for me.

It's called **Profile Optimizer**, and it's part of my open-source AI agent suite.

**What it does:**
✅ Analyzes your repos for missing keywords/topics.
✅ Auto-generates SEO-friendly descriptions using local NLP.
✅ Updates your profile README with a dynamic "Featured Projects" table.
✅ Totally local - no data sent to third parties (except GitHub API).

I built this because as a neurodivergent dev (ADHD), I forget to update my "marketing" stuff all the time. Now the code does it for me.

**Code is here:**
👉 [https://github.com/welshDog/My-GitHub-CareTaker](https://github.com/welshDog/My-GitHub-CareTaker)

(Check `profile_optimizer.py` in the root)

Would love feedback on the keyword extraction logic! 
```

## 📢 Platform 2: Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title:** Show HN: Open source GitHub profile optimizer for developers who hate self-promotion

**Comment:**

Author here. I built this tool to solve my own problem: I write a lot of code but forget to "sell" it on my profile. 

This Python script scans your public repos, extracts key tech stacks (Python, Rust, React, etc.), and rebuilds your profile README to highlight your actual skills dynamically.

It's part of a larger "CareTaker" agent system I'm building for neurodivergent developers to automate repository maintenance.

Your GitHub profile is your resume. But keeping it updated sucks. 😩

So I wrote a Python bot to do it for me. 🐍🤖

It scans my code, finds my best repos, and updates my profile SEO automatically.
