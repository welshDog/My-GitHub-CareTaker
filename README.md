The ultimate autonomous agent suite designed to optimize, clean, and visualize your GitHub ecosystem. Built with a neurodivergent-first approach, Caretaker automates the boring stuff so you can stay in the zone.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **HyperCode Duplicate Merge**: Intelligent analysis and consolidation of redundant code and repositories.
- **Neurodivergent UX**: Features like Hyperfocus Mode and 3D constellation visualizations.
- **Agent Swarm**: Multi-agent architecture for specialized tasks (Cleanup, Documentation, Security).
- **Automated Infrastructure**: Built-in CI/CD, security auditing, and performance metrics.
